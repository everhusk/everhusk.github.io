Hello there! I'm a Energy, Software, and Aerospace Engineer with a passion for pioneering solutions to the world's most pressing challenges. I am a strong advocate of harnessing the power of decentralized technology and clean energy for the betterment of our planet and future generations.

With a background in Aerospace Engineering, I further specialized in renewable energy systems to push the state of the art in Gen IV nuclear heat to conversion systems, striving to shape pragmatic solutions that mitigate the impacts of climate change. I needed money to pay for school, so I mined Dogecoin in my garage and ended up accumulating 2B dogecoin in the first two weeks, then got rugged by Coinye.

After leaving academia, I was lucky enough to help pioneer leading initatives in fintech as an early engineer / founding CTO. Some of these include Ethereum (started building dApps in 2015), LedgerX (the first CFTC regulated bitcoin options exchange, acquired by FTX to become FTX derivatives), Polymath (the first security token protocol). My experience at the leading edge allowed me to gain alpha into what the industry needed, and where to place my bets, enabling me to make several early investments in promising startups as well.

However, after all was said and done, I decided my passion still lies in the development of next generation energy systems, and planetary regeneration. I have a solid track record in creating innovative solutions that balance ecological stewardship with technological advancement, and am now working on Earth Wallet to combine the two, and hopefully make a meaningful impact on fighting climate change.
